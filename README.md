# Sample Work - README

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to contain sample documents (that are works-in-progress) that demonstrate my ability to use HTML and CSS.  
I am in the process of refreshing my knowledge of HTML5 and of strengthening my understanding of CSS3. I am also working on learning Markdown. 

## Contents

1. This readme file.
2. [The Writing Process] (https://github.com/Angelles/sample/blob/master/writingprocess3.html) - An HTML file containing CSS. The stylesheet is not separate.
